# Description

I made this project from Andrei Neagoie's The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Road Map course on udemy.

There is a fetch get request to robohash.org for the robot assets, and A fetch get request to jsonplaceholder for the other infomation displayed. This app is a basic crud app using React and tachyons for the css.

## This was made with create-react-app
